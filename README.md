# Developer Certification

Mastery of each category is achieved by scoring at least 80%.

## Assignment

The company "Super Fruit Inc" has a web application that their sales use for both field- and inside sales. The application lacks some functionalities, and the company is eager to shift to the Showpad eOS.

### Inside Sales

The application allows the sales rep to go through a catalog of fruit where they can reveal more information and download a PDF document about each fruit. Available fruits are:

- Blueberries
- Cranberries
- Pomegranates
- Grapes

**Super Fruit Inc requests:**
We want our PDFs to live in the Showpad content library instead of in the web application. Updates should be in real-time. We want insights into how often a PDF is viewed and the ability to share the PDF with the client.

### Field Sales

The application allows the sales rep to create, read, update, and delete a client (warehouse) in Localstorage. A client has the following information:

- Name (string)
- Fruits (Record<fruit, boolean>)

There is a button to generate a PDF document that downloads to the user's device. The sales reps then use their email application to send this PDF to their client.

**Super Fruit Inc requests:**
We want our clients to live in a database that syncs across the devices of our sales teams. When our app generates a PDF upload, it will be stored in Showpad instead of getting misplaced or forgotten on the user's local device storage.
